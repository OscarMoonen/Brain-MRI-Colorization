# Brain-MRI-Colorization

This repository contains the code used in the thesis "Producing structure preserving MRI colorizations with biologically plausible color distributions using a CycleGAN"

The code is made to run with Google Colab and can easily be implemented there. 


If you simply want to generate colorizations of MRI scans follow the following steps:
1. Download "loadModel.ipynb"
2. Downlaod "G_MC.pht"
3. Upload both files to Google Drive
4. Open "loadModel.ipynb" in Google Colab
5. Adjust folder locations as instructed in notebook
6. Upload MRI scans in .png format and 256x256 resolution
7. Run Model
8. Enjoy your MRI scans in color (:

If you want to run the model
1. Download "model.ipynb"
2. Go to the shared drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ulCaZs5tt95jY35-Zj3JBrPVYcXxT9DW?usp=sharing
3. Download "Cryodf.pkl" 
4. Download "MRIdf.pkl"  
5. Upload files to Google Drive
6. Open "model.ipynb" in Google Colab
7. Adjust file locations as instructed in notebook
8. Set preferred settings
9. Run Model
